Generating High-Dimensional Matrices with C++ for Improved Performance
In this project, I am using C++ code to generate high-dimensional matrices instead of RStudio because
the latter can be slow when dealing with large datasets. Specifically, the matrices I am generating are the VG and VI matrices used in statistical analysis.

Background
V-Matrix is the concept of solving ill-posed Fredholm integral equation that captures the mutual positions of observations

Approach
To improve performance, I have written C++ code using the Armadillo library for linear algebra and
OpenMP for parallelization. The code is optimized for performance, utilizing SIMD instructions and parallelization to compute the matrices efficiently.

Usage
The C++ code can be called from R using the Rcpp package. To compile and run the code, simply source
the VG.cpp and VI.cpp files in R and call the VG and VI functions with the required arguments.

Conclusion
By using C++ code instead of RStudio, I am able to generate high-dimensional matrices more efficiently,
saving time and computing resources. This approach can be useful for researchers and practitioners working with large datasets and complex statistical models.
